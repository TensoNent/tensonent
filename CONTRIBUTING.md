# Contributing Guideline

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

* Reporting a bug
* Discussing the current state of the code
* Submitting a fix
* Proposing new features
* Becoming a maintainer


## We Develop with GitHub

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.



### We use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), so all code changes happen through pull requests:

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively
welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from **master**
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Submit that pull request.

**Alternatively, You can use [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@d.kang/git-workflow-for-projects-cheat-sheet-35c3e51fb07c) for more details.**


## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) 
that covers the project.


## Reporting bugs using GitHub Issues

We use Github issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [Opening a new issue](https://github.com/TensoNent/tensonent/issues/new)

### Write bug reports with details and sample code

Great bug reports tend to have:
 * A quick summary and/or background
 * Steps to reproduce:
    * Be specific
    * Give sample code if you can
 * What you expected would happen
 * What actually happens
 * Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
 

## Use a consistent coding style

For more details, please review [this link](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

**Note: Use [PyCharm Professional IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) if you want to observe most of items above by default.**
